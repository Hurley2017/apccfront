**Context** - Bootstrap
Bootstrap - Provides a wide library of design components
Fully dynamic, light weight, optimized and easy to use library that gives ui a refreshed look and feel.
More detailed information on Bootstrap can be found here - [title](https://pypi.org/project/pytz/)

**Context** - Flask
Flask - Flask is considered more Pythonic than the Django web framework because in common situations the equivalent Flask web application is more explicit. Flask is also easy to get started with as a beginner because there is little boilerplate code for getting a simple app up and running.
Flask has many configuration values, with sensible defaults, and a few conventions when getting started. By convention, templates and static files are stored in subdirectories within the application’s Python source tree, with the names templates and static respectively. While this can be changed, we usually don’t have to, especially when getting started.
It is the main frame from where our frontend starts.

**Context** - AJAX - Jquery
Asynchronus JavaScript and XML is a method that uses a combination of technologies that allow the content on webpages to update immediately based on a user's action, which may be a click on a page or even a simple mouse movement. Just one or a few parts of the page may be refreshed, instead of reloading or refreshing the entire page. This differentiates AJAX from an HTTP request, during which users must wait for a whole new page to load. AJAX can also access data from external sources even after a webpage has loaded completely. The web handle requests are straight passed to AJAX Jquery to be forwarded to external api calls. It is also responsible for receiving the external data and pass to JavaScript for further operation.
AJAX uses JavaScript for dynamic content display, XHTML for content and XML to receive server data. In addition, it combines many other programming tools

#Topic = Components

i) **HTML** - As we are developing an Web based software, It bounds to follow traditional hypertext format which is HTML.
ii) **JavaScript** - It is a very complicated system where decision making is a frequent phenomena. By using JavaScript we can load components dynamically, handle data, communicate with backend, execute backend pulls and validate requests.
iii) **CSS[Cascading Style Sheets]** - To give our UI a refreshed yet simplified look, We used style sheets of our own as well as widely available bootstrap library.
iv) **JSON[JavaScript Object Notation]** - Our system prioritize data. Being a data-driven system, We had to comeup with different data structes, Among them we found Hashmap, hashlike data structure is more easy to use, Thus we decided to use JSON, where we can send chunks of object to backend to be processed. Being in hashlike fashion, JSON objects are easy to manipulate and can be unpacked in every programming language.
